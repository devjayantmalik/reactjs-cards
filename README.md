# Card UI Challenge
The project is a complete and it was created to practice react and redux skills.

My Plans was to use some online api, but then i decided to use static data, because I wanted to keep the project simple and straightforward.

It is completely possible to use **Redux Thunk** to use with redux and create this application, much more powerful.

Thanks, and have fun.
